HALLEY RESOURCES LICENSE // v2021.11.22

Copyright (c) 2022 husky

we establish that:
work: a creative pieces of some kind (music, film, video games, streaming, etc.)
you: the reader and/or user of HALLEY LABS RESOURCE CENTER works
HLRC: HALLEY LABS RESOURCE CENTER / emma essex @ HALLEY LABS

everybody is permitted to access and use the works provided through the HLRC in their own creations.

IT SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING, BUT IF YOU ARE CREATING WORK THAT IS BEING PUBLISHED BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP, THIS LICENSE APPLIES TO THEM AS WELL.

by utilizing works from HLRC in published (shared in some public way) work (commercial or otherwise), you are agreeing to the licensing following terms:
HLRC works licensing terms are non-negotiable.
HLRC works may only be used by "small works". HLRC defines "small works" as a piece of work (album/film/game/stream/etc) from an independent creator earning less than USD$100,000 per year. if you exist beyond this scope (earning more than USD$100,000/year or are not an independent creator) please contact emma@halleylabs.com for potential further licensing arrangements. any fees will be nominal and the process will be smooth.
HLRC works may not be resold/redistributed. to resell in this case is to take the works directly and sell it without transformative effort. to redistribute is to do the same free of payment. you cannot include these works directly in your own sample packs/virtual instruments/etc for resale/redistribution. you may not rehost these works while i am still offering them. in the case that they become unavailable, i will provide an update to this. always point people towards this page if they want access to the resources, as this page contains the license.
notable amounts of HLRC works (melodies, vocals, etc) may not be used in work being published to Spotify and must not be submitted to any kind of content ID databases - smaller elements such as percussion samples, synth/instrument one-shots, etc are OK for use (but i still recommend against content ID, it harms everybody's ability to use these works). please ask your publisher or distributor (if you have one) if they do this. if they do not allow you to opt out of content ID database submissions, the work must not be published through those means. you can still upload your work to Bandcamp, YouTube, SoundCloud, etc, of course.
HLRC works may not be used without permission by political groups or organizations, or to promote a political ideology. if you feel that HLRC works are a good fit for your message, please get in touch via emma@halleylabs.com and we can work on a case by case basis.
credit is only required in certain cases. while credit and a link back to halleylabs.com or here is always appreciated, it is only ever required when you personally feel as though you've used significant or identifiable amounts of the work.
HLRC works may not be used in any cryptocurrency or blockchain related media. this includes NFTs and other media published/minted to any blockchain or similar idea. HLRC is strictly post-scarcity.
HLRC asks that you consider creating a similar license for your work. this is not a necessity by any means, but i encourage all artists to create a library that others can pull from, given my reasoning above. retaining rights while allowing other independents to learn from your output is a great call in an otherwise overprotected world.
